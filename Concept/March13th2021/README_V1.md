# TimeoutToolkit concept March 13th 2021

Timeout Toolkit is a clock add-on, and a stand alone application that helps manage time outs. Time outs are a lot more ethical than spanking or hitting, and allows your child to think about what they have done. Also can be used as a break time tool.

## Features:

* Time reset button

* History

* Total number of resets (current session and all time)

* Plugin for clock apps
